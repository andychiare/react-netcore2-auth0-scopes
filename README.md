# react-netcore2-auth0-scopes

This repository contains two projects setting up a client-server system secured by using [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) services. 

Both projects are an evolution of [netcore2-auth0](https://github.com/andychiare/netcore2-auth0) and [react-auth0](https://github.com/andychiare/react-auth0) projects in order to show how to manage scopes using the [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) platform.

Refer to the README files of each project to setup them.
